    "This is the 3rd and final project of Term 3 and 13th overall as part Udacity's [Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](writeup/images/CarNDSyllabus.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves End-End system integration for Autonomous driving that involves Perception, Planning & Control. The project involves implementing ROS(Robot Operating System) nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following. The code will be first tested in Udacity's Simulator, and once it passes through this stage, the code will be fed to Udacity's real Self driving Car a.k.a. *Carla*\n",
