    "---\n",
    "This is the 3rd and final project of Term 3 and 13th overall as part Udacity's [Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](writeup/images/CarNDSyllabus.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves End-End system integration for Autonomous driving that involves Perception, Planning & Control. The project involves implementing ROS(Robot Operating System) nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following. The code will be first tested in Udacity's Simulator, and once it passes through this stage, the code will be fed to Udacity's real Self driving Car a.k.a. *Carla*\n",

    "### The Team\n",
    "This is the project where all the learning over past 8 months of the program are put together. Due to the complexity and the range of work involved, Udacity recommends to work on this project as a team. \n",
    "\n",
    "We formed a group of 4 and named our team '**Detroit Muscles**' as all of us belong to the Motor City Detroit. We are a team of 4 who worked on each of the individual components seperately, and finally worked together to integrate all of them\n",

    "Udacity's real Self Driving car called Carla follows the same architecture as mentioned above, and as part of this project, we implemented the Perception, Planning & Control modules. Carla uses ROS as its framework to implement and integrate all the nodes of the autonomous vehicle system. \n",

    "    Every autonomous vehicle's main perception comes through the camera feed. A cemera feed is nothing but a series of images. This node continuously processes these camera images through a Traffic light detection module to precisely identify the location of the traffic light in the image. This module is built using on top of the Tensorflow's Object detection model. The underlying implementation is a Convolutional Neural Network [Omkar TODO]. If there's no traffic light detected in a particular image, nothing is returned.\n",

    "* Traffic Light Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once the precise location of the traffic light is detected, that particular snippet is taken from the image and is sent through a Traffic Light Color Classifier. Humans require color images to identify but the computers(classifiers) can be trained to work on gray images so that computation is faster. The traffic light snippets will be converted to gray scale and hued [Omkar TODO] to finally classify the color of the light\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The output of this module will be the color of the traffic light. It returns either `RED` or `-1` if there's no traffic light in the image. To ensure the classification is 100% correct, we've implemented a logic to wait for atleast 3 consequent classifications of RED before its published to the topic.\n",
