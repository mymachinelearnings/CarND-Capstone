    "\n",
    "This project involves End-End system integration for Autonomous driving that involves Perception, Planning & Control. The project involves implementing ROS(Robot Operating System) nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following. The code will be first tested in Udacity's Simulator, and once it passes through this stage, the code will be fed to Udacity's real Self driving Car a.k.a. *Carla*\n",

    "    Every autonomous vehicle's main perception comes through the camera feed. A cemera feed is nothing but a series of images. This node continuously processes these camera images through a Traffic light detection module to precisely identify the location of the traffic light in the image. This module is built using on top of the Tensorflow's Object detection model. The underlying implementation is a Convolutional Neural Network [Omkar TODO]. If there's no traffic light detected in a particular image, nothing is returned.\n",

    "    Once the precise location of the traffic light is detected, that particular snippet is taken from the image and is sent through a Traffic Light Color Classifier. Humans require color images to identify but the computers(classifiers) can be trained to work on gray images so that computation is faster. The traffic light snippets will be converted to gray scale and hued [Omkar TODO] to finally classify the color of the light\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The output of this module will be the upcoming waypoint index whose traffic light is RED. It returns `-1` if there's no traffic light in the image. To ensure the classification is 100% correct, we've implemented a logic to wait for atleast 3 consequent classifications of RED before its published to the `/traffic_waypoints` topic.\n",

For ex, the vechicle need not adjust itself for something that 200m away from its current position. In the implementation, we considered the next 150 waypoints as an optimum number as we felt that this would give enough time for the vehicle to comfortably decelerate and adjust if a RED signal's approaching.\n",

    "    This node gets the upcoming traffic light information from `/traffic_waypoint` topic. If the upcoming signal is `RED`, then the vehicle needs to decelerate so that it stops at the traffic signal. For this, the waypoints from its current location until the traffic signal are calculated (provided they are within 150 waypoints) and corresponding velocities for each waypoint are associated so that its velocity when it reaches the `RED` traffic signal is 0. \n",

For obvious reasons, you don't want to break suddenly and that's why max deceleration limit is defined. The magnitude of braking is calculated in Newton-meter, and it depends on the vehicle mass and wheel radius. The higher are these terms, the more force you need to apply to slow down the vehicle\n",
